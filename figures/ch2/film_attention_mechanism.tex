    \caption{Visualizations of the distribution of locations used by the model for its globally max-pooled features, from which its final MLP makes predictions. FiLM correctly localizes the object referenced by the answer (top) or all objects referenced by the question (bottom). However, the localization is less accurate when the model provides an incorrect answer (rightmost bottom).}
