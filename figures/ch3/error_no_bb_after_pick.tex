    \caption{Example of an unsuccessful Pick-Place operation using the  ``no-bb after pick" variant. In this scenario, the robot successfully reaches the target box based on the predicted bounding box (blue). However, the single-control module prematurely predicts the closing command, preventing the robot from correctly picking up the object.}
