    \caption{Example of task rollout with incorrect object manipulation. In this scenario, the robot successfully completes the task by placing an object in the first bin. However, instead of manipulating the correct object (the green box), the robot mistakenly picks up the blue box. This illustrates a situation where the robot executes the task's final action correctly but selects the wrong object during manipulation.}
