% The distribution of trajectories for the different tasks along the x-y axis of the table workspace. Each plot represents a density map illustrating the frequency with which the robot's end-effector passed through specific points across all variations and trajectories.
%  The tasks are organized as follows: (Top-Left) Pick-Place, (Top-Right) Nut-Assembly, (Bottom-Left) Stack-Block, and (Bottom-Right) Press-Button.
