    \caption{Example of unsuccessful Press-Button rollout. In this scenario, the robot successfully reaches the target button using the predicted bounding box (blue). However, due to instability in predictions during the pushing phase, the robot is unable to complete the pressing action, resulting in an unsuccessful task execution.}
