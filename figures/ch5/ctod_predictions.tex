    \caption{(Top Row) Example of CTOD prediction. (Bottom Row) Example of COD prediction. The images illustrate one of the less accurate predictions. While the system successfully identifies the target (blue bounding box), the prediction is less precise compared to the ground truth (green bounding box), particularly for the target object. As shown, the offset error increases during placement, likely due to the object being occluded by the gripper. Additionally, some inaccuracies in the ground truth are caused by the automatic generation process.}
