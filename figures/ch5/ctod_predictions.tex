    \caption{(Top Row) Example of CTOD prediction. The image shows one of the system least accurate predictions. While it successfully identifies the target object (blue bounding box), the prediction lacks precision compared to the ground truth (green bounding box). As shown, the offset error increases during placement, likely due to the object being occluded by the gripper. Additionally, some inaccuracies in the ground truth result from the automatic generation process.. (Bottom Row) }
