    \caption{(Left) Trajectory distribution along the x-y axis of the real-world dataset. (Right) Trajectory distribution along the x-y axis of the simulated dataset, constrained to the same variations and number of trajectories as the real-world counterpart. It can be observed that the real-world dataset exhibits a much sparser and noisier distribution, due to the fact that the trajectories are collected via teleoperation.}
