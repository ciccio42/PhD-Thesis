    \caption{AWDA framework proposed in \cite{chang2023one}. The task inference network $f(v,o)$ predicts a sequence of attributed waypoints (red dots) that are achieved by hand-defined motion primitives. The original data are augmented with free-space motion trajectories and asymmetric demonstration mixup in order to reduce the correlation between tasks and task content.}
