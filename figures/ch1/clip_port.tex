    \caption{The Dual Stream architecture proposed in \cite{shridhar2022cliport} consists of two parallel streams: a semantic stream and a spatial stream. The semantic stream utilizes a frozen CLIP ResNet50 to encode the RGB input, with the decoder layers conditioned by tiled language features from the CLIP sentence encoder. Meanwhile, the spatial stream encodes the RGB-D input, and its decoder layers are laterally fused with those of the semantic stream. The final output is a map of dense pixelwise features, which is used to predict pick or place affordances.}
