    \caption{The performance comparison proposed in \cite{ho2016gail} is presented here. The y-axis shows the scaled reward, where the expert's reward is set to 1 and the random baseline is set to 0. The IRL baselines FEM and GTAL refer to the IRL algorithm described in \cite{ho2016model}, but with different cost functions.}
