\section{State of the art}
\label{sec:sota}
The chapter reviews the state of the art (SoTA) on the LfD problem. Specifically, Section~\ref{sec:problem_formulation} will focus on the formalization of the LfD problem. Then, Section~\ref{sec:lfd} will present various approaches and methodologies for solving the LfD problem. This will include a detailed taxonomy of the different approaches, highlighting their pros and cons, and concluding with considerations relevant to the goals of this thesis.
