This section will review the preliminary research conducted in the context of Object-Oriented Imitation Learning (Section \ref{sec:ooil}) to understand how previous studies have leveraged object priors to solve the Learning from Demonstration (LfD) problem. Additionally, it will examine research in the context of Visual-Question Answering (Section \ref{sec:vqa}) to highlight the specific challenges addressed by the COD module, while also presenting the methods that have primarily inspired the proposed solution.
