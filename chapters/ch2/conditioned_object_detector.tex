\chapter{Conditioned object detector}
\label{ch:cod}
As discussed in Section \ref{sec:motivation}, this thesis proposes a modular approach to solve the Visual-Conditioned Multi-Task Imitation Learning Problem. This chapter focuses on the module responsible for addressing an instance of the ``Cognitive Task" relevant to the context under consideration. Specifically, the approach aims to leverage an \textbf{object-prior} to enable the system to ignore distractor objects in the scene and focus on the target region of interest. To achieve this goal, a preliminary step is to develop a system capable of computing this object-prior. Therefore, this chapter will present and discuss the design of the Conditioned Object Detector (COD), which is specifically designed to solve a \textbf{novel variation} of the well-known Object Detection problem. Unlike traditional object detection tasks, where a deep architecture produces bounding boxes for all objects in the scene, this variation requires generating bounding boxes only for the regions of interest based on the demonstrated task.

Section \ref{sec:cod_related_works} will review relevant methods related to this task. 
Section~\ref{sec:cod_problem} outlines the detection problem being addressed. Section~\ref{sec:cod_architecture} describes the proposed architecture for solving this problem. Finally, Section~\ref{sec:cod_experimental} discusses the experimental setup and presents the results obtained from testing the proposed architecture.
