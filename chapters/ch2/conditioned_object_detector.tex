\chapter{Conditioned object detector}
\label{ch:cod}
In this chapter the COD is going to be described. Specifically, Section~\ref{sec:cod_problem} will outline the detection problem being addressed. Section~\ref{sec:cod_architecture} will detail the proposed architecture designed to solve the described problem. Section~\ref{sec:cod_experimental} will discuss the experimental setup and present the results obtained from testing the proposed architecture.
