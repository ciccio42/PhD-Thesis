\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:cod_experimental}
In this section, the performed experiments are going to be described. Specifically, in  
Section~\ref{sec:cod_dataset} the dataset used for training procedure will be described. Section~\ref{sec:cod_results} will report the obtained results.

\subsection{Results}
\label{sec:cod_results}
This section presents the obtained results, divided into two main blocks. The first block (Section~\ref{sec:cod_tod}) discusses the results of the method trained to detect only the target object. The second block (Section~\ref{sec:cod_tod}) covers the results of the method trained to detect both the target object and the final (placing) location. For each method, results are reported for two different scenarios: first, where the method is trained in a single-task multi-variation scenario; and second, where the method is trained in a multi-task multi-variation scenario.
