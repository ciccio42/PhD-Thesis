\section{Experimental results}
\label{sec:ocpl_experimental}

In this section, the performed experiments are going to be described. Specifically, in  
Section~\ref{sec:ocpl_dataset} the dataset used for training procedure will be described. Section~\ref{sec:ocpl_results} will report the obtained results.

\subsection{Results}
\label{sec:ocpl_results}
This section presents the obtained results, divided into two main blocks. The first block (Section~\ref{sec:ocpl_results_scm}) discusses the results of the method described in Section\ref{sec:ocpl_architecture_scm}. The second block (Section~\ref{sec:ocpl_results_dcm}) covers the results of the method described in \ref{sec:ocpl_architecture_dcm}. For each method, results are reported for two different scenarios: first, where the method is trained in a single-task multi-variation scenario; and second, where the method is trained in a multi-task multi-variation scenario.
