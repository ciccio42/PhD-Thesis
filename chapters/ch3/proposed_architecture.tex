\section{Architecture}
\label{sec:ocpl_architecture}
This section describes the entire policy architecture, specifically focusing on how the COD (Chapter~\ref{ch:cod}) is integrated. There are two control architectures, differing in how the final control module predicts actions. Section~\ref{sec:ocpl_architecture_scm} details the architecture that uses a single control module to predict actions for both the reaching and placing phases. In contrast, Section~\ref{sec:ocpl_architecture_dcm} describes the architecture that divides the control module into two distinct parts: one for computing actions during the reaching phase, and another for the placing phase.
