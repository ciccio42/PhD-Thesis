\chapter{Graph Neural Network for heuristic estimation}
The goal of this chapter is to evaluate and review the possibility of leveraging Graph Neural Network (GNN) in the context of robotics learning. Specifically, this chapter will devided into different sections: Section \ref{sec:gnn_related_works} will discuss the related works and in general the application of GNN in the context of Learning from Demonstration.
