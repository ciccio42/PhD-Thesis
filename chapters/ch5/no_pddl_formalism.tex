\subsection{Alternative Formalism}
\label{sec:gnn_alternative_formalism}

In this section, methods that do not rely on classical planning formalism will be discussed. These approaches focus on directly using a graph-based representation of the environment, where nodes represent objects and edges denote either relationships between objects or actions. This enables the use of GNN architectures to process the graph and select the next high-level action the robot should perform. The following paragraphs will describe the different ways the environment can be represented and how the network output is translated into the corresponding action for the robot.
