This section reviews prior research on the application of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to robot learning tasks. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:gnn_taxonomy}, GNNs can be applied in various ways; however, they all share a common underlying principle: leveraging GNNs capability to explicitly model dynamic relationships between objects involved in robotic manipulation. This ability to capture and represent interactions between objects is vital for effective robotic perception, planning, and task execution, as these relationships often govern the complexity and success of manipulation tasks.

In general, most research has focused on solving \textit{task planning} problems. According to classical literature \cite{geffner2013concise}, a task-planning problem can be defined as a state-transition model $\Pi = \left( S, A, s_{0}, G \right)$, where $S$ is the set of states, $A$ is the set of actions, $s_{0}$ is the initial state, and $G$ is the goal state. Here, an action $a \in A$ is a function that maps a state $s \in S$ to a new state (successor) $a(s)$, i.e., $a: S \rightarrow S$. Essentially, a plan is a sequence of actions $\tau = a_{1}, a_{2}, \dots, a_{n}$ that enables the system to transition from the initial state $s_{0}$ to the goal state $s_{n} = a(s_{n-1}) = G$. Various approaches have been proposed to solve the problem of finding a plan given a specific initial and goal state. These approaches either adhere to the classical PDDL formalism \cite{aeronautiques1998pddl}, and thus fit within the traditional planning framework, or introduce novel representations that do not rely on PDDL to address the planning problem.

This review begins by examining methods that follow the \textit{Classic Planning Formalism}  (Section \ref{sec:pddl_formalism}), followed by a brief discussion of novel approaches that do not use this kind of formalism (Section \ref{sec:gnn_alternative_formalism}).
